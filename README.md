dot files
=========

This is my current set of dotfiles.


Installation
------------

You can install this by running the _install.sh_ script. This can be done remotely:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewfranglen/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash

Future Plans
------------

In future it will be possible to update remote hosts (it is possible now, but it will be better when there is a dedicated server playbook).

In future it will be possible to do a sudo-less installation (no actions requiring sudo permitted).

In future it will be possible to supplement roles to apply to the remote server (allowing for host specific content).

In future more things will be available built from source, and it should be easy to install them.
